First time making a markdown file let's hope this works.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>What I already knew</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I've already made entire game projects in github</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How to pull, push, branch, clone and create new repositories</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>What I've learned</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What a markdown file is</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How to make a table in markdown (hopefully)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I hope my "MonHunTamers" repo is enough proof that I'm familiar with the features of a repository.
